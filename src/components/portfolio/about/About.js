			<p className="about-paragraph">After I completed my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in 2018, I got involved with a crypto-currency community called EOS. 
				Working and debating with developers on a daily basis inspired me to become one.
				Because of this I joined Lambda, a 9 month coding academy where I learned how to build powerful applications using agile methodologies in a team setting.
				I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
